# TRIANGLE TRACKER
An application that will help us know whether a triangle is `isosceles,` `equilateral,` `scalene` or `NOT a triangle at all`.

## Functionality
- [X] For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
- [X] For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.
- [X] For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
- [X] Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values. (For example, the values 9,4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.)
